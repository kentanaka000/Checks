A To-Do List App that automatically sends e-mail updates at specified intervals, which holds the user accountable/keeps them connected to people they care about.

For example, someone could keep their mother up to date about whether they are going to bed on time, or a physical therapist could be kept up to date about whether their patient is following their program successfully.
